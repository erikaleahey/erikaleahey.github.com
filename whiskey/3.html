		<p>The mash is transferred to a fermentation vessel, usually open in the United States. 
		These vessels can be made out of wood, or stainless steel (for bourbon, always wood). 
		Yeast is added to begin fermentation, which converts the sugars in the mash to alcohol. 
		The yeast can be added as new yeast cells (sweet mash process) or by using a portion of 
		a previous batch of fermentation (sour mash).  </p>

	  <div id="column2">
		<p>The sour mash process is often used because it's effective at room temperature, and 
		its low pH promotes yeast growth and inhibits the growth of bacteria. The sweet mash 
		process is more difficult to control, and must be used at temperatures above 80ÂºF. After 
		three or four days, the end product, called "distillers beer"is a liquid containing about 10% alcohol.
