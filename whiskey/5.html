		<p>Water is added to the high wine to reduce it's alcohol content to about 50-60%. 
		American whiskeys are aged in warm, dry conditions so that they lose water and become
		 more alcoholic. Whiskey is aged in wooden barrels, usually made of charred white oak. 
		 White oak is one of the few woods than can hold liquid without leaking, but allows for 
		 the whiskey to move within the pores of the wood, which helps add flavor. The barrels 
		 are usually new and only used once.   </p>

		<p>There are three factors to the aging process. First, the mixture of water, alcohol, 
		and congeners react with each other over time. Then, the ingredients react with oxygen 
		in oxidation reactions. Third, the water absorbs substances from the wood as it moves within 
		it. Whiskey generally takes three or four years to mature, with many being aged ten or fifteen years.
