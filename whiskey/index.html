		<p>Whiskey is a distilled spirit obtained from the fermented mash of grain, 
		distilled at less than 190 proof, stored in oak containers and bottled at a 
		minimum of 40% abv. Gin and vodka are also distilled from a mash of grain, 
		but whiskey's maturation process in oak containers is what makes it unique. 
		Oak is air permeable, which helps oxidize the distillate and releases flavor 
		compounds through wood chemicals such as lignin and vanillin. Whiskey is also 
		initially distilled at a low alcohol by volume, which allows flavor compounds 
		called congeners remain in the distillate. Therefore, the flavor of whiskey is 
		not compromised, and retains a fuller, richer taste. Whiskey is ultimately an 
		umbrella term: just as beer has a variety of styles, whiskey also has a number 
		of varieties that fall under its general description.
