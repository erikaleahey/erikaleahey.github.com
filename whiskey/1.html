		<p>Truckloads of grain are shipped directly from farms to the whiskey manufacturer 
		to be stored in silos. It is inspected and cleaned to remove dust and foreign particles. 
		All grains except barley are ground into a meal in a gristmill. The meal is mixed with 
		water and cooked to break down the cellulose walls that starch granules.</p>

	  <div id="column2">
		<p>Instead of being cooked, the barley is malted. This is achieved by soaking the 
		barley in water until it is thoroughly saturated. Then it is spread out and sprinkled 
		with water for about three weeks, until it begins to sprout. During this germination, 
		the enzyme amylase is produced, which converts the starch in the barley to sugars. To 
		halt the sprouting, barley is dried and heated with hot air from a kiln. The malted barley 
		is then ground like other grains.
