     <h1>Proposal</h1>
     <p>I plan on creating an interactive website that couples with my degree project, which is an education system for novice whiskey drinkers. The website will act as a tool to pair with point of sale features that will be integrated into liquor stores. Novice drinkers can access this website for more information on whiskey and how it is manufactured. For more information on my project, visit: <a href="http://whiskeybehavior.tumblr.com" target="_blank">whiskeybehavior.tumblr.com</a>
     <br><br>
     The website will made entirely as a parallax slider, that allows the user to follow the education materials start to finish by clicking the arrows on either side of the current page. Alternatively, there will be a tool bar that allows the user to jump to various sections of the website, such as the "What is Whiskey?" or "How It's Made" list. For each step of the manufacturing process, there will be CSS animations detailing what the text explains. 
     <br><br>
     The above sketches hopefully give a rough idea of what the site will look like. I want to use as much hand drawn lettering and illustrative elements as possible, and have full page images sitting behind the text elements.
